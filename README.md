## Introduction

>This project allows users to control a robotic arm from anywhere in the world using a website 🌐. The website provides a control panel 🕹 and a 3D viewport 🏗, which >shows the live movement of the arm in a virtual world 🌎.
>
>I created this project to learn more about robotics 🤖 and web development 💻. I hope that others will find it useful and inspiring 💡.
>
>The project is still under development, but it is already functional 🟢. I plan to add more features in the future, such as the ability to control multiple arms 🤖 and the ability to interact with the environment 🌍.
>
>The code for the project is available on GitHub 🚀. I welcome anyone to contribute to the project or to use it for their own purposes. 💡

## Features
- **3D viewport**: 🏗️ The project provides a 3D viewport that allows users to see the live movement of the arm in real time ⏱️. This makes it easy to control the arm and to see the results of their actions.

- **Position recording**: 💾 The project also allows users to record the position of the arm for later use. This can be useful for tasks such as repeating a sequence of movements or for creating a training dataset. 📚
  
- **Remote control**: 🌐 The project can be controlled from anywhere in the world. This makes it possible to use the arm from a remote location, such as from a different room or from another country. 🌍
